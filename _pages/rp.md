## Replication Participants (RP)

Replication Participants conduct a **local replication** of the jointly designed study in their own instructional context.

### What RPs do

- Implement the replication in one or more courses
- Collect and submit data using shared instruments and procedures
- Participate in regular cohort meetings
- Contribute to cross-site analysis and dissemination
- Optionally publish:
  - a paper on their local replication
  - or join the broader meta-analysis manuscript

### Who should apply

- Computing educators interested in empirical CER
- Researchers newer to replication or large-scale studies
- Faculty teaching relevant courses (e.g., CS1/CS2, software engineering, capstone)

Replication Participants also receive a **stipend** to support their involvement.

### What topics will we study?

Each cohort focuses on a **single CER topic** selected for community relevance and research potential.  
The first replication cohort will study **assessing team contributions**, with future cohorts addressing additional topics identified through systematic literature review and community input :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

### What support do participants receive?

Participants are not expected to “figure this out alone.”

The project provides:

- A fully developed replication package
- Shared data collection and analysis tools
- IRB guidance and templates
- Monthly cohort meetings
- Ongoing mentoring from the PI team and RDT
- Support for dissemination and publication
