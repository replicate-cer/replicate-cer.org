## Replication Design Team (RDT)

Replication Design Teams are small groups of researchers who **co-design** a coordinated replication study.

### What RDT members do

- Help define a shared research question within a selected CER topic
- Identify meaningful dimensions of variation (e.g., institutional context, student populations, instructional practices)
- Co-develop:
  - a data collection plan
  - a common analysis strategy
  - a replication timeline
  - a template IRB application
- Participate in an intensive, in-person design workshop
- Mentor Replication Participants throughout the study

### Who should apply

- Researchers with prior experience in the topic area
- Faculty interested in research design, replication, and meta-analysis
- Researchers from a variety of institution types (e.g., R1s, liberal arts colleges, community colleges, MSIs)

RDT members receive a **stipend** in recognition of the time and leadership required.
