REPLICATE-CER is an NSF-funded project focused on strengthening **computing education research (CER)** by supporting **coordinated, multi-site replication studies**. Our goal is to make replication *practical, valuable, and rewarding*—and to use it as a foundation for theory building in CER.

We are recruiting researchers and educators to join upcoming **replication cohorts**, either as members of a **Replication Design Team** or as **Replication Participants**.

## Why replication?

Replication is essential for building confidence in empirical results and for enabling meta-analysis and theory development. Yet fewer than 3% of published CER studies report replications, in part because replication is difficult to organize, difficult to publish, and often undervalued.

This project addresses those challenges by:

- Designing **replication packages** collaboratively
- Coordinating **families of studies** across institutions
- Supporting shared **data collection, analysis, and dissemination**
- Centering **equity-enabling research practices**
- Creating structures that make replication feasible at scale :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Two ways to participate

- [Replication Design Team](/rdt)
- [Replication Participant](/rp)

## Project Mission

This project is intentionally designed to:
- Broaden participation across institution types and researcher backgrounds
- Support equity-enabling research practices
- Value collaboration over novelty
- Treat replication as *foundational scholarship*, not secondary work
